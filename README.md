Developer-Evangelist-Job-Posting-Analysis
=========================================

This repo contains a Ruby script to count the frequency of words in a text file. The script will return an array of hashes, where the key is the word and the value is the number of time that word appears in the text file. 

The "top-250-words.txt" file contains results of the top 250 most common words from a sample of 27 developer evangelist/advocate job postings.
